<h1>Project: Deploying MongoDB and Express</h1>
<p>The objective is to set up two applications, MongoDB and Express, and enable communication between them in a Kubernetes cluster. To achieve this, a MongoDB deployment and an internal service are created, and an Express deployment requires credentials and a database URL. These are passed through environmental variables in a configuration file that uses a config map and secret. An external service is also created to allow external requests to access Express through a browser. The request flow starts from the browser and goes to the external service of Express, which forwards it to the Express pod. The pod connects to the internal service of MongoDB using the database URL and credentials for authentication.
</p>
<p>The project contains the following files:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>README.md</li>
		<li>K8s-commands.md</li>
		<li>mongo-express.yaml</li>
		<li>mongo.yaml</li>
		<li>mongo-configmap.yaml</li>
		<li>mongo-secret.yaml</li>
	</ul>
<p>These files contain YAML code to create the necessary Kubernetes resources to deploy MongoDB and Express.</p>
<p>For more details on the commands used and the YAML files, refer to the K8s-commands.md file. To view the running pods, services, and secrets, use the "kubectl get" command. To debug issues, use the "kubectl describe" command or view the logs with "kubectl logs". To access the external service in minikube, use the "minikube service" command.</p>
<p>To deploy the project, clone the repository and run the kubectl apply commands specified in the K8s-commands.md file.</p>
